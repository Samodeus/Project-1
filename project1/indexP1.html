    <p> Hello my name is Miguelangel. I am a Senior at lehman college majoring in CIS(Computer Information systems)
    Im currently taking <a href="http://comet.lehman.cuny.edu/sfulakeza/">CMP 128</a>, I have some knowledge of HTML and CSS 
    from a class in lehman CIS 228. I also have experience in MYSQL from another course I took recently, I was never really a coder but the classes I have just mentioned
    have changed all that and now see coding as fun and intresting. I am very proficient in hardware and general IT since my Highschool had offered IT as a course.</p>

    <p> I hope from this course I am able to learn more about HTML and CSS, I took this course as fluff to fill up my schedule
    but was excited to hear that it course was teaching HTML and CSS. I dont see myself becoming a coder in the future, as a job that would be perfect for me will be
    one where I help people fix general computer problems like that at an IT help desk. Although I don't really see myself diving more into the field of coding, the more and more I do learn about HTML, CSS or even MYSQL the more I think is fun and well worth it to perhaps seek a job in the field.
    Another perfect job for me would be building computers or fixing them, I am really good with hardware and find it exciting tinkering with the inside of a PC.
